Assignment: Amazing Project Submission

General Layout: Sample results stored in results directory. To run test script, run BATS_TSE.sh in the cs50-Raboso directory. 
		To manually run the program chamge into the AMStartup directory and run AMStartup with the appropriate parameters
		from there. *NOTE* printf graphics will be running the entire time if it is manually run.

Defensive programming: Checks for number of arguments, valid number of avatars/difficulty, valid hostname.
	  	       Returns error message and exits.

Functionality: Fully works. Results saved to log file in results directory. 

Algorithm: We used a modified wall follower. Essentially it uses the left-hand rule to make moves. However, it also fills in dead ends
	   and leaves breadcrumb trails for other avatars to follow each other. Because every avatar updates everybody's knowledge of where
	   walls and breadcrumbs are, we bypass the need for shared memory and semaphores.


Testing: BATS_TSE.sh first builds and tests the amazing project. It also performs unit tests on major functions.
